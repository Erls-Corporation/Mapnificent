Mapnificent
===========

Mapnificent is a framework for overlaying an HTML5 canvas element on Google Maps to visualize geographical information.


The current main use case for this framework is [http://www.mapnificent.de](Mapnificent Berlin Rush Hour) and [http://london.mapnificent.de](Mapnificent London Night Buses), a visualization inspired by [http://mapumental.channel4.com](Mapumental).

The framework and layers are released under [Creative Commons by-nc-sa](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0).

A documentation about how to write layers for Mapnificent is available at docs/index.html

Mapnificent currently uses jQuery/jQuery UI and only works with Google Maps. Looking forward to an OSM fork.
