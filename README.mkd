Mapnificent
========

Mapnificent is a framework for overlaying geographical data on Google Maps using Canvas and JavaScript. No Flash or Tile-Servers. A live example with the really cool "Urban Distance" layer (inspired by http://mapumental.channel4.com) and other small layers can be found on http://www.mapnificent.de .

The framework is currently released under Creative Commons by-nc-sa: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0
The license might get more free in the future.

A documentation on how to write layers for Mapnificent is available at docs/index.html

A blog article how mapnificent was created can be found here: http://blog.stefanwehrmeyer.com/post/449810520/mapnificent

Mapnificent currently uses ELabel by Mike Williams and jQuery/jQuery UI. It only works with Google Maps.
